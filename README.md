# Password_Generator

## Homework 3

The assignment generates a random password using the following requirements:

The user clicks the button labeled "Generate Password" and is then asked the questions below:

* How many characters for your password? An input form appears that allows the user to enter a number between 8-128. If the input is any character other than a number the user is alerted to "Start Over".
* Should your password contain lowercase letters?
* Should your password contain uppercase letters?
* Should your password contain numbers?
* Should your password contain special characters?

Once all criteria is confirmed by the user, the site generates a new secure password in the text area.
